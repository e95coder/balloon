//main file from sample final project
//This sample game was for a course project in Coursera. Requirements were that it needed some navigation and settings pages as well 
//as some particle effects, scoring system and badges through Apple
//Game play is with touch only. When you touch the screen the main character moves in that direction. If you touch below the character
//it uses the pulse feature to push the character up. Touching right or left of the character enables pulse feature to
//move character in that direction.
//A moving plane at the top of the game shoots boxes. Character can fly around to collect coins. Boxes are deterrants.
//Other ideas for the game included having colored boxes be collectable for more points or enabling other features, and also
//an idea to shake the phone and make the boxes explode.
